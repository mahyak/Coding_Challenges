```
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```
 

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

Solution
========
```
Solution1: Using two pointer, search in s[l:r], benefit S:O(1)
Solution2: Using two pointers, and dictionary to store latest index of each character -> T:O(N)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        longest = 1

        if len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        
        l, r = 0, 1

        while r < len(s):
            if s[r] in s[l:r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                longest = max(longest, len(s[l:r+1]))
                r += 1
        
        return longest
                

# T: O(n^2)
# S: O(1)
```
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        latest_index = {}
        max_len = 0
        l = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            if s[r] in latest_index:
                l = max(l, latest_index[s[r]] + 1)
            latest_index[s[r]] = r    
            max_len = max(max_len, r-l+1)
        
        return max_len

# T: O(N)
# S: O(N)    

```
